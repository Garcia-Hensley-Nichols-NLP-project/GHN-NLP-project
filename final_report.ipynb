    "\n",
    "### Big Idea\n",
    "\n",
    "Determine the primary programming language of a GitHub repository by using natural language processing (NLP) techniques on their `README.md`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Predict the programming language of a repo by using NLP on the `README.md\n",
    "2. Conclude if there is a statistically significant difference between `README.md` lengths from the top 3 most common languages.\n",

    "\n",
    "We start by searching github.com for repo's related to the search term \"bitcoin\". This search is done via GitHub's API and a list is extracted that contains the url path to 100 related repos. We use the list to ascertain the contents of the `README.md` from each repo. The path and language of the repo are gathered additionally.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now begins the challenge of quantizing communications in the english lanuage. NLP attempts to do just that by utilizing cutting edge computational power. Common parsing techniques are used on the original corpus collected from GitHub. In this project, the contents of an individual `README.md` are treated as a document. Each document is changed to all lower case letters, has punctuation removed, is tokenized, and has stop-words removed as a function of basic cleaning. Further preprocessing includes stemming and lemmetization. Column names are changed for convenience and the all languages other than the top 3 are consolidated into category 'other'. The tidied strings are returned in a single Pandas dataframe.\n"
